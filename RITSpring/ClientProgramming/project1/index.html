CREATED BY DANIEL MCKEE FOR ISTE 340 CLIENT PROGRAMMING

Notes:
> Data is scalable and can take as many option inputs as needed/inputted
> Cookies save through the form, storing the first name of the user and printing it onto the title of the page (and the form is also validated)
> Local storage holds the user's last complete selection list history
> Code is a bit of a mess, left comments where it was most messy

This project was fun, and I am going to try to expand this further on my own time
