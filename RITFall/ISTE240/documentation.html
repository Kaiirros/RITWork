        <h1>Good Design Techniques</h1>

        <p class="content-paragraph">I believe this criteria was met. I am very proud with the design of the site and the overall blending of colors and images. Things can always be improved on, but I believe this is suitable for now.
            When we continue further with the website, I will make neccessary changes.
        </p>

        <h1>Organization of Information</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">All images and content regarding the specified places related to the page. Each city has their own City/State regional map borders and flag included, as well as photos from the place. 
        </p>

        <h1>Content</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">All grammar has been checked and hopefully nothing has snuck by. Although I do not have every single city or state in Germany as a page, I wanted to include the specific places that I visited and had insight in.
        </p>

        <h1 class="content-header">Quantity of Content</h1>
        <h1>Content Pages</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">The minimum of 10 pages for this site has been passed, and each page has neccessary information as well as cool photos that can show the user what it looked like. If I could, I would add
            more information to each page, and I will do so even past this deadline, but for now it is all I have available.
        </p>

        <h1 class="content-header">More Miscellaneous</h1>
        <h1>Code Design Requirements</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">All CSS and HTML code is indented properly and validated. Comments have been made throughout the CSS file. All code is my own, although I have used 
            (minimal) help from w3schools.</p>   

        <h1>Interaction Design & Navigation</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Global navigation played a key part in this project, and I am happy to say it works effectively. Definitely a pain to manually do, maybe other techniques to learn in future.
        </p>  

        <h1>HTML & CSS Validates / Cross Browser Compatibility</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Yes! 
        </p>  

        <h1>Grading Page Document</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph"><a href="./documentation.html">Here :) (and in homepage)</a></p> 

        <h1>Responsive</h1>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Yes, and I actually enjoyed doing it surprisingly.</p>
